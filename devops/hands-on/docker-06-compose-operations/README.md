# Hands-on Docker-06 : Docker Compose Operations

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give the students understanding to Docker Compose.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- explain what Docker Compose is.

- install docker-compose-cli

- explain what the `docker-compose.yml` is.

- build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Part 2 - Installing Docker Compose

- Part 3 - Building a Web Application using Docker Compose

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

## Part 2 - Installing Docker Compose

- For Linux systems, after installing Docker, you need install Docker Compose separately. But, Docker Desktop App for Mac and Windows includes `Docker Compose` as a part of those desktop installs.

- Download the current stable release of `Docker Compose` executable.

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Check if the `Docker Compose`is working.

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

## Part 3 - Building a Web Application using Docker Compose

- Create a folder for the project:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir composetest
cd composetest
```

- Create a file called `app.py` in your project folder and paste the following python code in it. In this example, the application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis, and  `redis` is the hostname of the `Redis container` on the applicationâ€™s network. We use the default port for Redis, `6379`.

```bash 
touch app.py
```

```python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)


def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

- Create another file called `requirements.txt` in your project folder, add `flask` and `redis` as package list.

```bash
touch requirements.txt

echo '
flask
redis
' > requirements.txt

# To check the file contents

cat requirements.txt

```


- Create a Dockerfile which builds a Docker image and explain what it does.

```bash
touch Dockerfile

echo '
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST 0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
' > Dockerfile
```

- Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project folder and define services and explain services.

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml

echo '
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
' > docker-compose.yml

```

- Build and run your app with `Docker Compose` and explains what is happening.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Add a rule within the security group of Docker Instance allowing TCP connections through port `5000` from anywhere in the AWS Management Console.

```bash 
Type        : Custom TCP
Protocol    : TCP
Port Range  : 5000
Source      : 0.0.0.0/0
Description : -
```

- Enter http://`ec2-host-name`:5000/ in a browser to see the application running.

- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop containers, and run `docker ps -a` to see containers created by Docker Compose.

- Remove the containers with `Docker Compose`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```
