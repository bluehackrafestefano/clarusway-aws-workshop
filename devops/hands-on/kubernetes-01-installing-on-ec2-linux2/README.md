# Hands-on Kubernetes-01 : Installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu 18.04 running on AWS EC2 Instances

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of how to install and configure Kubernetes on Ubuntu 18.04 EC2 Instances.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- install Kubernetes on Ubuntu 18.04.

- explain steps of the Kubernetes installation.

- set up a Kubernetes cluster.

- explain the Kubernetes architecture.

- deploy a simple server on Kubernetes cluster.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Setting Up Kubernetes Environment on All Nodes

- Part 2 - Setting Up Master Node for Kubernetes

- Part 3 - Adding the Slave/Worker Nodes to the Cluster

- Part 4 - Deploying a Simple Nginx Server on Kubernetes

## Part 1 - Setting Up Kubernetes Environment on All Nodes

- In this hands-on, we will prepare three nodes for Kubernetes on `Ubuntu 18.04`. One of the node will be configured as the Master node, rest two will be the worker nodes. Following steps should be executed on all nodes. *Note: It is recommended to install Kubernetes on machines with `2 CPU Core` and `2GB RAM` at minimum to get it working efficiently. For this reason, we will select `t2.medium` as EC2 instance type, which has `2 CPU Core` and `4 GB RAM`.*

- Hostname change of the nodes, so we can discern the roles of each nodes. For example, you can name the nodes (instances) like `manager, worker-1 and worker-2`

```bash

```

- Install helper packages for Kubernetes.

```bash

```

- Update app repository and install Kubernetes packages and Docker.

```bash

```

- Start and enable Docker service.

```bash

```

- Start and enable `kubelet` service.

```bash

```

- Add the current user to the `Docker group`, so that the `Docker commands` can be run without `sudo`.

```bash

```

- As a requirement, update the `iptables` of Linux Nodes to enable them to see bridged traffic correctly. Thus, you should ensure `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables` is set to `1` in your `sysctl` config and activate `iptables` immediately.

```bash

```

- Explain briefly required ports for Kubernetes.

### Control-plane (Master) Node(s)

|Protocol|Direction|Port Range|Purpose|Used By|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|TCP|Inbound|6443|Kubernetes API server|All|
|TCP|Inbound|2379-2380|`etcd` server client API|kube-apiserver, etcd|
|TCP|Inbound|10250|Kubelet API|Self, Control plane|
|TCP|Inbound|10251|kube-scheduler|Self|
|TCP|Inbound|10252|kube-controller-manager|Self|

### Worker Node(s)

|Protocol|Direction|Port Range|Purpose|Used By|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|TCP|Inbound|10250|Kubelet API|Self, Control plane|
|TCP|Inbound|30000-32767|NodePort Servicesâ€ |All|

## Part 2 - Setting Up Master Node for Kubernetes

- Following commands should executed on Master Node only.

- Pull the packages for Kubernetes beforehand

```bash

```

- Let `kubeadm` prepare the environment for you. Note: Do not forget to change `<ec2-private-ip>` with your master node private IP.

```bash

```

> :warning: **Note**: If you are working on `t2.micro` or `t2.small` instances,  use the command with `--ignore-preflight-errors=NumCPU` as shown below to ignore the errors.

```bash

```

> :info: **Note**: There are a bunch of pod network providers and some of them use pre-defined `--pod-network-cidr` block. Check the documentation at the References part. We will use Calico for pod network. Calico can use any `--pod-network-cidr` block.

- In case of problems, use following command to reset the initialization.

```bash

```

- After successful initialization, you should see something similar to the following output (shortened version).

```bash
...
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

  kubeadm join 172.31.3.109:6443 --token 1aiej0.kf0t4on7c7bm2hpa \
      --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0e2abfb56733665c0e6204217fef34be2a4f3c4b8d1ea44dff85666ddf722c02
```

> Note to the Instructor: Note down the `kubeadm join ...` part in order to connect your worker nodes to the master node. Remember to run this command with `sudo`.

- Run following commands to set up local `kubeconfig` on master node.

```bash

```

- Activate the `Calico` pod networking and explain briefly the about network add-ons on `https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/`.

```bash

```

- Master node (also named as Control Plane) should be ready, show existing pods created by user. Since we haven't created any pods, list should be empty.

```bash

```

- Show the list of the pods created for Kubernetes service itself. Note that pods of Kubernetes service are running on the master node.

```bash

```

- Show the details of pods in `kube-system` namespace. Note that pods of Kubernetes service are running on the master node.

```bash

```

- Get the services available. Since we haven't created any services yet, we should see only Kubernetes service.

```bash

```

- Show the list of the Docker images running on the Master node to enable Kubernetes service.

```bash

```

## Part 3 - Adding the Slave/Worker Nodes to the Cluster

- Show the list of nodes. Since we haven't added worker nodes to the cluster, we should see only master node itself on the list.

```bash

```

- Run `docker container ls` on the worker nodes command to list the Docker images running on the worker nodes. We should see an empty list.

- Log into worker nodes and run `sudo kubeadm join...` command to have them join the cluster.

```bash

```

- Get the list of nodes. Now, we should see the new worker nodes in the list.

```bash

```

- Get the details of the nodes.

```bash

```

- Show the list of the Docker images running on the Master node to enable Kubernetes service.

```bash

```

## Part 4 - Deploying a Simple Nginx Server on Kubernetes

- Check the readiness of nodes at the cluster on master node.

```bash

```

- Show the list of existing pods in default namespace on master. Since we haven't created any pods, list should be empty.

```bash

```

- Get the details of pods in all namespaces on master. Note that pods of Kubernetes service are running on the master node and also additional pods are running on the worker nodes to provide communication and management for Kubernetes service.

```bash

```

- Create and run a simple `Nginx` Server image in a pod on master.

```bash

```

- Get the list of pods in default namespace on master and check the status and readyness of `nginx-server`

```bash

```

- Expose the nginx-server pod as a new Kubernetes service on master.

```bash

```

- Get the list of services and show the newly created service of `nginx-server`

```bash

```

- Forward the port of `service/nginx-server` so that we can check if the Nginx Server is working.

```bash

```

- Open a browser and check the `public ip` of master node to see Nginx Server is running.

- Clean the service and pod from the cluster.

```bash

```

- Check there is no pod left in default namespace.

```bash

```

- To delete a worker/slave node from the cluster, follow the below steps.

  - Drain and delete worker node on the master.

  ```bash
  
  ```

  - Remove and reset settings on the worker node.

  ```bash
  
  ```
  
> Note: If you try to have worker rejoin cluster, it might be necessary to clean `kubelet.conf` and `ca.crt` files and free the port `10250`, before rejoining.
>
> ```bash
>  sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
>  sudo rm /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
>  sudo netstat -lnp | grep 1025
>  sudo kill <process-id>
>  ```
